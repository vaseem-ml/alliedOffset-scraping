This methodology details how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions may be calculated, and credits issued, from the installation and usage of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
This project includes the installation of EV charging infrastructure that will be utilised to charge applicable electric vehicle fleets. The use of this charging infrastructure results in the avoidance of fossil fuel powered vehicle usage and therefore a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions from the alternative energy supply.
This project will initially include a number of chargers and will subsequently add additional chargers for registration via legal agreements that preclude chargers that participate in this project from participating in any other GHG reduction scheme. For details relating to estimated abatement quantities, refer to Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals.

"Methane Gas Capture and Electricity Production at Kubratovo Wastewater Treatment Plant, Sofia, Bulgaria",15797,BG,"The project is both a methane emissions reduction and energy production project.Methane produced in Kubratovo wastewater treatment plant is captured in common methanetanks serving as a buffer and then supplied to the newly installed CHP gas engines forelectricity and heat production, which in turn will substitute both the plant’s electricity purchasesfrom the grid and diesel fuel usage. Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009.",AMS-I.C.

The overall objective of the VPA is to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the dissemination of domestic biogas systems as a local, sustainable energy source and the development of a commercially viable, market-oriented biogas sector. By encouraging the switch from traditional non-renewable biomass (NRB) fuels to renewable biogas the VPA is reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. TDBP is the sector leader with the responsibility of coordinating, facilitating and monitoring sector functions and supporting the technical, financial and institutional architecture necessary for development of the domestic biogas sector in Tanzania. The VPA is to be implemented based on private sector market oriented principles, but developing governmental support for a favourable regulatory and policy environment, as well as general buy-in promotion and extension. The emissions reductions achieved through the VPA will generate carbon credits, the revenue from which will be used to subsidise the biodigesters and biogas stoves, making them more affordable for use in households, SMEs and communities.
Apart from reducing emissions, the VPA will contribute to the sustainable development through reduction of deforestation and the need for artificial fertilizers, reduction of indoor air pollution and time spent obtaining biomass for cooking, increase of employment opportunities in the biogas industry and improvement of crop yields and diversity through use of bio-slurry produced by the digester.",GS TPDDTEC v 2.,,3.9148461630829234,"https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=1,29&z=7&t=p&hl=en-GB&gl=US&mapclient=apiv3"

Project Blue,15833,GQ,"Project Blue is a zero-energy, water-filtration project located in Guinea, West Africa, that is designed to bring access to clean drinking water to 2.5 million people in the rural/developing regions of the country and to increase the status of women in the country.  
 
To have access to clean water, Guineans are harvesting wood from local forests and mangroves.  This wood is burned to boil the water to make it safe to drink.  Through this practice, carbon and other particulate matter are released into the environment. 
 
Project Blue seeks to eliminate the current carbon-emitting and deforestation practices through use of a gravity-fed, water filter that eliminates virtually all harmful bacteria.  These highly-durable filters easy to use and have a long life span for repeated use, which will encourage adoption and also limit the environmental impact.  
 
Additionally, the country's women carry on the brunt of the activities associated with collecting and burning wood. Since the filtration project would largely eliminate the need for such activities, women are then freed to engage in activities that will improve their status, such as becoming educated or engaging in other gainful activities. Indeed,  because of social dynamics within the locales where the project will take place, it is anticipated that women will comprise the overwhelming majority of the workforce that handles the distribution and administration of the filtration project.

Little Sun Energy and Improved Living Programme of Activity,14433,ET,"The Little Sun Energy and Improved Living Programme of Activity aims at the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions and the improvement of the socio-economic situation of
households in East African countries, especially in Ethiopia. The Program addresses two
drivers for inhouse pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based
lamp devices with solar energy technology as well as inefficient stoves with more energy
efficient cook stoves. These will be distributed to households and small holders in the
project region, thereby helping to reduce fuel costs and risks for diseases in the
respiratory systems and the eyes. Further tens of millions of schoolchildren in Africa
cannot study after dark because they live without electricity. After school, children often
help their families with household chores and agricultural tasks and once they turn their
attention to homework, their neighbourhoods and villages are in almost complete
darkness. By the distribution of solar lamps to school children this program will contribute
to expanding study hours to night-time and reduces costs of unhealthy sources of light.
As the project targets the improvement of livelihood in households this project targets as
well the traditional cooking methods which are often inefficient, dangerous, and harmful
to the environment. The Programme aims at providing especially women with improved
stoves that improve health, safe time, firewood, and money. The stoves aim at reducing
50% of the timber used so less time is spent in gathering firewood, a task traditionally
carried out by children and women that takes up to 20 hours a week. The new stove also
emits less smoke and will result in less eye and respiratory diseases It is the aim of the
program to support local developers of clean cook stoves in order to support their
development and support technology that is reflecting the needs and was approved by
local communities.

kids, household solar PV applications, solar water pumps, and clean cookstove
technologies.",Other,,4.380181824736185,

Her-Fried Utilization of Coalmine Methane,16768,DE,In the German Ruhr district there have been industrial hard coal mining activities for more than hundred years. In the whole area there are more than 100 known shafts. The coal-mine-methane that is captured in this project would otherwise escape directly through cracks and fissures and diffuse through the overburden rocks into the atmosphere. The project couples the production of power with the conversion of the 21-times stronger green-house-gas methane into carbon dioxide.,AMS-III.D.,57348,4.515768448886773,
